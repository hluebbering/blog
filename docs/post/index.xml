      <description>IntroductionSpace exploration is a global endeavor that has continued to progress for over seven decades. These efforts rely on advancements in technology, rockets, satellites, rovers, and more. And with each planetary science mission and related activity comes tremendous spending costs and expenditures. However, such space exploration efforts and expenses are constantly changing based on national priorities, budget proposals, destinations, the role of prominent programs, research, launch spending, and more.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe robustness and high-level expression performed by neurons in the human brain are still unclear today. Consequently, the field of Neuroscience is still far from understanding how the brain operates and solves complex tasks such as differentiating classic rock from classical music or recognizing a visual representation of a person or object, all of which take only a fraction of a second.</description>

      <description>Sample SpacesProblem 0.1Sara and Megan are two students who show up for a standardized test. Sara has a \(\tfrac{1}{8}\) chance of passing the test, whereas Megan has a \(\tfrac{5}{12}\) chance. What are the chances that at least one of them will pass the test?
Solution. Let \(A\) denote the event that Sara passes the test and \(B\) denote the event that Megan passes. Then we have that \(P(A) = \tfrac{1}{8}\) and \(P(B)=\tfrac{5}{12}\).</description>

      <description>Singular Value DecompositionsTheorem (The Singular Value Decomposition).  Let \(A\) be an \(m \times n\) matrix with rank \(r\). Let \(D\) be the \(r \times r\) diagonal matrix where the diagonal entries are the nonzero singular values of \(A\) in decreasing order \(\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_r \gt 0\). Let \(\Sigma\) be the \(m \times n\) matrix that has \(D\) in the upper left corner and zero everywhere else.</description>

      <description>PageRank as a Markov Chain Sergy Brin and Larry Page developed PageRank as a way to rank the importance of a webpage on the internet based on the counted number of links to it. For example, consider the following internet:
 Figure 1: PageRank as a Markov Chain.  \(\require{color}\definecolor{teall}{RGB}{58, 171, 174} \definecolor{bluemoon}{RGB}{62, 71, 125} \definecolor{redhot}{RGB}{255, 145, 115} \definecolor{periwinkle}{RGB}{159, 160, 255} \definecolor{purpley}{RGB}{31, 35, 255} \definecolor{gween}{RGB}{73, 175, 129} \definecolor{pinky}{RGB}{251, 109, 134} \definecolor{pinky2}{RGB}{241, 67, 192} \definecolor{maglav}{RGB}{241, 167, 254}\)</description>

      <description>Convergence of a Sequence Definition. (Sequence Convergence)  A sequence \((a_n)\) converges to a real number \(a\) if, for every positive number \(\epsilon\), there exists an \(N \in \mathbb N\) such that whenever \(n \geq N\) it follows that \(\left|a_n − a\right| \lt \epsilon\).
In the following, we will determine whether a given sequence converges to a certain limit, and then we’ll use Python to illustrate the sequence graphically.</description>
